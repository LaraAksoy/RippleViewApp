# RippleView

RippleView is a dynamic SwiftUI application that allows users to create interactive visual stories by placing landmark stickers on a scrollable canvas. Designed with a focus on fluid gestures and playful animations, this app demonstrates the power of SwiftUI's animation and gesture systems.

## ✨ Features
